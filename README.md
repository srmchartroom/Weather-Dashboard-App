# Weather-Dashboard-App
This application is a means to snag key weather data from a weather api and display in a dashboard format.  The intent is to create a functional app that can be dropped in other sites, pages, and applications to provide user-friendly read out of weather based on preferred location and localMemory storage, and dynamically update the HTML and CSS accordingly.
